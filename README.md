# Biosvend

## Problem

Program a model of a vending machine. It should at least satisfy the following requirements:

* Contains various products, each of which can be retrieved by entering in the correct amount of money, and punching in the code for that item
* Dispenses change after making a purchase
* Has a cancel button that returns the user's change
* Ability to stock/restock items in the machine
* Any other functionality that you think a vending machine should have!

It is not required that you build any sort of user interface, but there should be some demonstration of the modelâ€™s functionality.  Write this code as if it were going into production.
